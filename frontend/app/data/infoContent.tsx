# BingoIRL

**BingoIRL** is a fun, customized bingo game designed to play with friends, family, or coworkers. Each player receives a bingo card with squares tailored to specific actions and quirks related to individuals in the group, making every square feel personal and memorable.

## How to Play BingoIRL

1. **Prepare the Bingo Cards:** Each player receives a blank BingoIRL card. Before the game starts, players fill in each square with specific scenarios or actions tied to group members. Examples include:
   - "Edward will arrive late"
   - "Sarah will tell a story about her cat"
   - "Tom will make a pun or dad joke"
   - "Linda will reference her last vacation"
   - "Jake will ask for help with something tech-related"

2. **Gameplay:** As the event unfolds, players observe the group and mark off squares as they see each specified action happen.
   - For example, if one square says “Emily will talk about her new workout” and Emily brings it up, everyone with that square can mark it off.

3. **Winning the Game:** The first player to complete a full row, column, or diagonal shouts “BingoIRL!” and wins the game.
   - The winner receives a pre-decided prize, which could be anything from a small reward to bragging rights.

## Tips for a Great BingoIRL Game

- Make each square specific but likely to happen, so the game remains challenging and fun.
- Customize the squares for themed events (e.g., holiday-specific actions or inside jokes).
- Adjust the win condition for longer games—consider two rows, four corners, or even a blackout!

_With personalized squares, BingoIRL becomes a fun way to celebrate each other's quirks and habits!_
